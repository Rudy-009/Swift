# Swift
Documenting my learning journey in Swift programming. 
According to the https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language

01. The Basics
- Work with common kinds of data and write basic syntax.
02. Basic Operators
- Perform operations like assignment, arithmetic, and comparison.
03. Strings and Characters
- Store and manipulate text.
04. Collection Types
- Organize data using arrays, sets, and dictionaries.
05. Control Flow
- Structure code with branches, loops, and early exits.
06. Functions
- Define and call functions, label their arguments, and use their return values.
07. Closures
- Group code that executes together, without creating a named function.
08. Enumerations
- Model custom types that define a list of possible values.
09. Structures and Classes
- Model custom types that encapsulate data.
10. Properties
- Access stored and computed values that are part of an instance or type.
11. Methods
- Define and call functions that are part of an instance or type.
12. Subscripts
- Access the elements of a collection.
13. Inheritance
- Subclass to add or override functionality.
14. Initialization
- Set the initial values for a type’s stored properties and perform one-time setup.
15. Deinitialization
- Release resources that require custom cleanup.
16. Optional Chaining
- Access members of an optional value without unwrapping.
17. Error Handling
- Respond to and recover from errors.
18. Concurrency
- Perform asynchronous operations.
19. Macros
- Use macros to generate code at compile time.
20. Type Casting
- Determine a value’s runtime type and give it more specific type information.
21. Nested Types
- Define types inside the scope of another type.
22. Extensions
- Add functionality to an existing type.
23. Protocols
- Define requirements that conforming types must implement.
24. Generics
- Write code that works for multiple types and specify requirements for those types.
25. Opaque and Boxed Protocol Types
- Hide implementation details about a value’s type.
26. Automatic Reference Counting
- Model the lifetime of objects and their relationships.
27. Memory Safety
- Structure your code to avoid conflicts when accessing memory.
28. Access Control
- Manage the visibility of code by declaration, file, and module.
29. Advanced Operators
- Define custom operators, perform bitwise operations, and use builder syntax.
